# Using themes

// TODO from here

----

(details to document:)

3 locations for theme definitions:
    * global configuration = global theme
    * configuration in subdir overrides global theme
    * navigation.md
    
theme in config.json > priority navigation.md - reasons: mdwiki compatible, setting in navigation can be kept for mdwiki, in config.json can use advanced Up definition, when Up and mdwiki are used both for some reason

----

The place to add your theme definition is the navigation.md, which like this allows 
one different theme wherever you have structured your documents in separate directories.
