## Individual navigations

You have the feature to create separate navigations for subfolders. By adding a navigation.md in the specific subfolder,
Up! will create a different navigation for all files in this subfolder and all subfolders.

This is optional though. If Up! can't find a navigation.md in the folder the md file exists, it will search the parent folders until it finds
one and use it.
