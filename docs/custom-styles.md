### Using a custom style (work in progress)

Up! adds classes and id's to sections like navigation and footer. This way, you can change the look of any elements
of the final pages.

To add custom styles, simply create a custom.css file in the main folder. It will be loaded after any other styles.

For now, as no such list exists, inspect the generated files to see what classes and id's are available for
custom styling.



### Custom modifications for all pages

You want to add your own modifications in the html that is generated? Nothing easier than that. Find the file
page.tpl in the Up folder and edit it as you wish. You only need to keep the variables like {$meta} in place.
