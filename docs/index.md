# Quick Start

Welcome to the Up! documentation.

Up! will help you to construct a website or wiki with rich content, with no knowledge of PHP, HTML and CSS, 
while it gets completely out of your way and allow you to focus almost completely to the authoring task. 

It uses MarkDown, a widely accepted, easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain-text format. It is so easy, 
documents can be read and make perfect sense also without conversion into HTML. It should be easy for anyone 
to start writing documentation, wiki and any other documents or even websites like this, without learning 
technologies like HTML and CSS. 

Gimmicks allow to integrate other technologies into it in a simple straight-forward way, hiding away any implementation details. 

The [Getting Started](getting-started.md) will guide you through your first steps. 

Afterwards, you can add [Navigation](navigation.md) to your site. 

You can use also some [Advanced Features](advanced-features.md) and integrate external content like Youtube videos by 
using the [Gimmicks](gimmicks.md) syntax (which is not MarkDown-specific, but rather an extension, however it degrades nicely).
